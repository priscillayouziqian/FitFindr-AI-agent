# FitFindr — planning.md

> Complete this document before writing any implementation code.
> Your spec and agent diagram are what you'll use to direct AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) to generate your implementation — the more specific they are, the more useful the generated code will be.
> Your planning.md will be reviewed as part of your submission.

## Tools

List every tool your agent will use. For each tool, fill in all four fields.
You must have at least 3 tools. The three required tools are listed — add any additional tools below them.

### Tool 1: search_listings

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `description` (str): ...
- `size` (str): ...
- `max_price` (float): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value — what fields does a result contain? -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if no listings match? -->

---

### Tool 2: suggest_outfit

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `new_item` (dict): ...
- `wardrobe` (dict): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if the wardrobe is empty or no outfit can be suggested? -->

---

### Tool 3: create_fit_card

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `outfit` (...): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if the outfit data is incomplete? -->

---

### Additional Tools (if any)

<!-- Copy the block above for any tools beyond the required three -->

---

## Planning Loop

**How does your agent decide which tool to call next?**
<!-- Describe the logic your planning loop uses. What does it look at? What conditions change its behavior? How does it know when it's done? -->

---

## State Management

**How does information from one tool get passed to the next?**
<!-- Describe how your agent stores and accesses state within a session. What data is tracked? How is it passed between tool calls? -->

---

## Error Handling

For each tool, describe the specific failure mode you're handling and what the agent does in response.

| Tool | Failure mode | Agent response |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| search_listings | No results match the query | |
| suggest_outfit | Wardrobe is empty | |
| create_fit_card | Outfit input is missing or incomplete | |

---

## Architecture

<!-- Draw a diagram of your agent showing how the components connect:
     User input → Planning Loop → Tools (search_listings, suggest_outfit, create_fit_card)
                                                                          ↕
                                                                   State / Session
     Show what triggers each tool, how state flows between them, and where error paths branch off.
     ASCII art, a Mermaid diagram (https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), or an embedded
     sketch are all fine. You'll share this diagram with an AI tool when asking it to implement
     the planning loop and each individual tool. -->

## AI Tool Plan

<!-- For each part of the implementation below, describe:
     - Which AI tool you plan to use (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
     - What you'll give it as input (which sections of this planning.md, your agent diagram)
     - What you expect it to produce
     - How you'll verify the output matches your spec before moving on

     "I'll use AI to help me code" is not a plan.
     "I'll give Claude my Tool 1 spec (inputs, return value, failure mode) and ask it to implement
     search_listings() using load_listings() from the data loader — then test it against 3 queries
     before trusting it" is a plan. -->

**Milestone 3 — Individual tool implementations:**

**Milestone 4 — Planning loop and state management:**

## A Complete Interaction (Step by Step)

Write out what a full user interaction looks like from start to finish — tool call by tool call. Use a specific example query.

FitFindr is an AI agent that takes a user's natural language request to search for secondhand clothing, finds matching items, and suggests how to style them using the user's existing wardrobe. It sequentially triggers three tools: searching for listings based on the parsed query, generating an outfit recommendation using the found item, and creating a social media fit card. If a tool fails (such as finding zero search results), the agent gracefully halts the process and returns a helpful error message to the user instead of proceeding with empty data.

**Example user query:** "I'm looking for a vintage graphic tee under $30. I mostly wear baggy jeans and chunky sneakers. What's out there and how would I style it?"

**Step 1:**
<!-- What does the agent do first? Which tool is called? With what input? -->
The agent parses the user's query and calls the `search_listings` tool with `description="vintage graphic tee"` and `max_price=30.0`. If no items match, it stops the interaction and returns an error message. If items match, it returns a list of results and selects the top match.

**Step 2:**
<!-- What happens next? What was returned from step 1? What tool is called now? -->
Using the top match from Step 1, the agent calls the `suggest_outfit` tool, passing the selected item and the user's wardrobe data. It returns an outfit suggestion string. If the user's wardrobe is empty, it handles this gracefully by returning general styling advice instead.

**Step 3:**
<!-- Continue until the full interaction is complete -->
The agent calls the `create_fit_card` tool, passing the outfit string from Step 2 and the selected item details. It returns a short, shareable social media caption. If the outfit data is missing or incomplete, it returns a descriptive error message instead of crashing.

**Final output to user:**
<!-- What does the user actually see at the end? -->
The user sees three distinct outputs: the details of the top listing found, the customized outfit idea incorporating their wardrobe items, and a catchy 2-4 sentence "fit card" caption ready for social media.
